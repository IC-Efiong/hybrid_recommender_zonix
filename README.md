# Hybrid Recommendation Engine for E-Commerce  

This project implements a **Hybrid Recommendation System** for an e-commerce app with social media features. It combines **Collaborative Filtering (SVD)** and **Content-Based Filtering (TF-IDF)** to enhance product discovery. This is just a testing code for understanding the concept and how work with the real data. 

## Features  
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Users, products, and interactions (purchases, likes, shares, comments).  
- **Hybrid Recommendation System**: Merges collaborative & content-based filtering.  
- **Personalization & Monetization**: Supports personalized ads & promotions.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG@K for performance assessment.  

## How to Use  
1. **Generate Data**: Run `synthetic_data_gen.py`.  
2. **Train & Recommend**: Execute `recommendation_engine.ipynb`.  
3. **Evaluate Performance**: Run evaluation metrics in the notebook.  

ðŸš€ Future updates will include **FastAPI deployment**.
